    AISIX is a preemptively multitasking operating system. It's written chiefly
for the purpose-built LIMNstation platform, which has a custom RISCy CPU and
other cool stuff. The OS is written in a custom programming language called
dragonfruit and aims to teach me (the author) more about computer architecture,
compiler design, etc, and may even help someone else if they're masochistic
enough to read any of my code. You could also say that it aims to prove that
you can write an operating system in even the most contrived, borderline-turing-
tarpit programming language and environment.

    I hope to "finish" it some day, which will involve writing a LOT more
syscalls and utilities, improving the kernel as much as I can, and eventually
writing a window system. As a concept, this has been in development since late
2016, so it has taken a pretty long time just to get to this point. I expect to
spend a lot more time on it.

Thanks for trying it out :)
